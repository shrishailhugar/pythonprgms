# here set will be called from python if no local functions present else it will call local
#else here i've written same set function in another file differntfile.py from there it will execute if it's not present in local file
#YOU SHOULD IMPORT FUNCTION NOT ONLY FILE
#if that's present in both local and imported file then it will go for inbuilt function
